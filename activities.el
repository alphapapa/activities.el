;;; Commentary:

;; Inspired by Genera's and KDE's concepts of "activities", this
;; library allows the user to select an "activity", the loading of
;; which restores a window configuration into a `tab-bar' tab or
;; frame, along with the buffers shown in each window.  Saving an
;; activity saves the state for later restoration.  Switching away
;; from an activity saves the last-used state for later switching back
;; to, while still allowing the activity's initial or default state to
;; be restored on demand.  Resuming an activity loads the last-used
;; state, or the initial/default state when a universal argument is
;; provided.

;; The implementation uses the bookmark system to save buffers'
;; states--that is, any major mode that supports the bookmark system
;; is compatible.  A buffer whose major mode does not support the
;; bookmark system (or does not support it well enough to restore
;; useful state) is not compatible and can't be fully restored, or
;; perhaps not at all; but solving that is as simple as implementing
;; bookmark support for the mode, which is usually trivial.

;; Integration with Emacs's `tab-bar-mode' is provided: a window
;; configuration or can be restored to a `tab-bar' tab or to a frame.

;; Various hooks are provided, both globally and per-activity, so that
;; the user can define functions to be called when an activity is
;; saved, restored, or switched from/to.  For example, this could be
;; used to limit the set of buffers offered for switching to within an
;; activity, or to track the time spent in an activity.

;; implementation.

;;;; Debugging

(require 'warnings)

;; NOTE: Uncomment this form and `emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load'
;; the file to enable `activities-debug' messages.  This is commented
;; out by default because, even though the messages are only displayed
;; when `warning-minimum-log-level' is `:debug' at runtime, if that is
;; so at expansion time, the expanded macro calls format the message
;; and check the log level at runtime, which is not zero-cost.

;; (eval-and-compile (setq-local warning-minimum-log-level nil) (setq-local warning-minimum-log-level :debug))

(cl-defmacro activities-debug (&rest args)
  "Display a debug warning showing the runtime value of ARGS.
The warning automatically includes the name of the containing
function, and it is only displayed if `warning-minimum-log-level'
is `:debug' at expansion time (otherwise the macro expands to a
call to `ignore' with ARGS and is eliminated by the
byte-compiler).  When debugging, the form also returns nil so,
e.g. it may be used in a conditional in place of nil.

Each of ARGS may be a string, which is displayed as-is, or a
symbol, the value of which is displayed prefixed by its name, or
a Lisp form, which is displayed prefixed by its first symbol.

Before the actual ARGS arguments, you can write keyword
arguments, i.e. alternating keywords and values.  The following
keywords are supported:

  :buffer BUFFER   Name of buffer to pass to `display-warning'.
  :level  LEVEL    Level passed to `display-warning', which see.
                   Default is :debug."

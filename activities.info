activities.el
*************

Inspired by Genera’s and KDE’s concepts of "activities", this library
allows the user to select an "activity", the loading of which restores a
window configuration and/or frameset, along with the buffers shown in
each window.  Saving an activity saves the state for later restoration.
Switching away from an activity saves the last-used state for later
switching back to, while still allowing the activity’s initial or
default state to be restored on demand.  Resuming an activity loads the
last-used state, or the initial/default state when a universal argument
is provided.

   The implementation uses the bookmark system to save buffers’
states–that is, any major mode that supports the bookmark system is
compatible.  A buffer whose major mode does not support the bookmark
system (or does not support it well enough to restore useful state) is
not compatible and can’t be fully restored, or perhaps not at all; but
solving that is as simple as implementing bookmark support for the mode,
which is usually trivial.

   Integration with Emacs’s ‘tab-bar-mode’ is provided: a window
configuration or frameset can be restored to a window or set of frames,
or to a tab or set of tabs.

   Various hooks are (or will be–feedback is welcome) provided, both
globally and per-activity, so that the user can define functions to be
called when an activity is saved, restored, or switched from/to.  For
example, this could be used to limit the set of buffers offered for
switching to within an activity, or to track the time spent in an
activity.

1 Installation
**************

Until this library is available from a package archive, it’s recommended
to install it using Quelpa (https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa):

  1. Install quelpa-use-package
     (https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation)
     (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
  2. Add this form to your init file (which includes a recommended
     configuration):

     (use-package activities
       :quelpa (activities :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/activities.el")

       :bind
       (("C-x C-a l" . activities-list)
        ("C-x C-a a" . activities-resume)
        ;; For convenience, we also bind `activities-resume' to "C-a", so the
        ;; user need not lift the Control key.  This makes it easier to
        ;; quickly switch between activities.
        ("C-x C-a C-a" . activities-resume)
        ("C-x C-a RET" . activities-switch)
        ("C-x C-a g" . activities-revert)
        ("C-x C-a n" . activities-new)
        ("C-x C-a s" . activities-suspend)
        ;; Alias for `activities-suspend'.
        ("C-x C-a C-k" . activities-kill))

       :init
       ;; Automatically save activities' states when Emacs is idle and upon
       ;; exit.
       (activities-mode)
       ;; Open activities in `tab-bar' tabs (otherwise frames are used, but
       ;; the author doesn't test that as much).
       (activities-tabs-mode))

   If you choose to install it otherwise, you’ll need to load both the
‘activities’ and ‘activities-tabs’ libraries, or ensure that the
autoloads are generated properly.

2.1 Activities
==============

For the purposes of this library, an "activity" is a window
configuration and its associated buffers.  When an activity is
"resumed," its buffers are recreated and loaded into the window
configuration, which is loaded into a frame or tab.

   From the user’s perspective, an "activity" should be thought of as
something like, "reading my email," "working on my Emacs library,"
"writing my book," "working for this client," etc.  The user arranges a
set of windows and buffers according to what’s needed, then saves it as
a new activity.  Later, when the user wants to return to doing that
activity, the activity is "resumed," which restores the activity’s
last-seen state, allowing the user to pick up where the activity was
left off; but the user may also revert the activity to its default
state, which may be used as a kind of entry point to doing the activity
in general.

2.2 Compatibility
=================

This library is designed to not interfere with other workflows and
tools; it is intended to coexist and allow integration with them.  For
example, when ‘activities-tabs-mode’ is enabled, non-activity-related
tabs are not affected by it; and the user may close any tab using
existing tab commands, regardless of whether it is associated with an
activity.

2.3 Modes
=========

‘activities-mode’
     Automatically saves activities’ states when Emacs is idle and when
     Emacs exits.  Should be enabled while using this package (otherwise
     you would have to manually call ‘activities-save-all’, which would
     defeat much of the purpose of this library).
‘activities-tabs-mode’
     Causes activities to be managed as ‘tab-bar’ tabs rather than
     frames (the default).  (_This is what the author uses; bugs present
     when this mode is not enabled are less likely to be found, so
     please report them._)

2.4 Workflow
============

An example of a workflow using activities:

  1. Arrange windows in a tab according to an activity you’re
     performing.
  2. Call ‘activities-new’ (‘C-x C-a n’) to save the activity under a
     name.
  3. Perform the activity for a while.
  4. Change window configuration, change tab, close the tab, or even
     restart Emacs.
  5. Call ‘activities-resume’ (‘C-x C-a C-a’) to resume the activity
     where you left off.
  6. Return to the original activity state with ‘activities-revert’
     (‘C-x C-a g’).
  7. Rearrange windows and buffers.
  8. Call ‘activities-new’ with a universal prefix argument (‘C-u C-x
     C-a n’) to redefine an activity’s default state.
  9. Suspend the activity with ‘activities-suspend’ (‘C-x C-a s’) (which
     saves its last state and closes its frame/tab).


File: README.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: Bookmarks,  Prev: Workflow,  Up: Usage

2.5 Commands
============

‘activities-list’ (‘C-x C-a l’)
     List activities in a ‘vtable’ buffer in which they can be managed
     with various commands.
‘activities-new’ (‘C-x C-a n’)
     Define a new activity whose default state is the current frame’s or
     tab’s window configuration.  With prefix argument, overwrite an
     existing activity (thereby updating its default state to the
     current state).
‘activities-suspend’ (‘C-x C-a s’)
     Save an activity’s state and close its frame or tab.
‘activities-kill’ (‘C-x C-a C-k’)
     Alias for ‘activities-suspend’.
‘activities-resume’ (‘C-x C-a C-a’)
     Resume an activity, switching to a new frame or tab for its window
     configuration, and restoring its buffers.  With prefix argument,
     restore its default state rather than its last.
‘activities-revert’ (‘C-x C-a g’)
     Revert an activity to its default state.
‘activities-switch’ (‘C-x C-a RET’)
     Switch to an already-active activity.
‘activities-discard’
     Discard an activity permanently.
‘activities-save-all’
     Save all active activities’ states.  (‘activities-mode’ does this
     automatically, so this command should rarely be needed.)

2.6 Bookmarks
=============

When option ‘activities-bookmark-store’ is enabled, an Emacs bookmark is
stored when a new activity is made.  This allows the command
‘bookmark-jump’ (‘C-x r b’) to be used to resume an activity (helping to
universalize the bookmark system).

3 FAQ
*****

How is this different from Burly.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el) or Bufler.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el/)?
     Burly is a well-polished tool for restoring window and frame
     configurations, which could be considered an incubator for some of
     the ideas furthered here.  Bufler’s ‘bufler-workspace’ library uses
     Burly to provide some similar functionality, which is at an
     exploratory stage.  ‘activities’ hopes to provide a longer-term
     solution more suitable for integration into Emacs.

How does this differ from "workspace" packages?
     Yes, there are many Emacs packages that provide "workspace"-like
     features in one way or another.  To date, only Burly and Bufler
     seem to offer the ability to restore one across Emacs sessions.  As
     mentioned, ‘activities’ is intended to be more refined and easier
     to use (e.g.  automatically saving activities’ states when
     ‘activities-mode’ is enabled).  Comparisons to other packages are
     left to the reader; suffice to say that ‘activities’ is intended to
     provide what other tools haven’t, in an idiomatic, intuitive way.
     (Feedback is welcome.)

How does this differ from the built-in ‘desktop-mode’?
     As best this author can tell, ‘desktop-mode’ saves and restores one
     set of buffers, with various options to control its behavior.  It
     does not use ‘bookmark’ internally, which prevents it from
     restoring non-file-backed buffers.  As well, it is not intended to
     be used on-demand to switch between sets of buffers, windows, or
     frames (i.e.  "activities").

"Activities" haven’t seemed to pan out for KDE. Why would they in Emacs?
     KDE Plasma’s Activities system requires applications that can save
     and restore their state through Plasma, which only (or mostly
     only?)  KDE apps can do, limiting the usefulness of the system.
     However, Emacs offers a coherent environment, similar to Lisp
     machines of yore, and its ‘bookmark’ library offers a way for any
     buffer’s major mode to save and restore state, if implemented
     (which many already are).

Why did a buffer not restore correctly?
     Most likely because that buffer’s major mode does not support Emacs
     bookmarks (which ‘activities’ uses internally to save and restore
     buffer state).  But many, if not most, major modes do; and for
     those that don’t, implementing such support is usually trivial (and
     thereby benefits Emacs as a whole, not just ‘activities’).  So
     contact the major mode’s maintainer and ask that ‘bookmark’ support
     be implemented.

Why did I get an error?
     Because ‘activities’ is at an early stage of development and some
     of these features are not simple to implement.  But it’s based on
     Burly, which has already been through much bug-fixing, so it should
     proceed smoothly.  Please report any bugs you find.

(https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/activities.html)

   Inspired by Genera’s and KDE’s concepts of "activities", this Emacs
library allows the user to manage frames/tabs, windows, and buffers
according to their purpose.  An "activity" comprises a frame or tab, its
window configuration, and the buffers displayed in them–its "state";
this state would be related to a certain task the user performs at
various times, such as developing a certain software project, reading
and writing email, working with one’s Org mode system, etc.

   "Suspending" an activity saves the activity’s state and closes its
frame/tab; the user would do this when finished with the activity’s task
for the time being.  "Resuming" the activity restores its buffers and
windows to its frame/tab; the user would do this when ready to resume
the task at a later time.  This saves the user from having to manually
arrange the same windows and buffers each time the task is to be done.

   Each activity saves two states: the default state, set when the
activity is defined by the user, and the last-used state, which was how
the user left it when the activity was suspended (or when Emacs exited,
etc).  This allows the user to resume the activity where the task was
left off, while also allowing it to be reverted to the default state,
providing a consistent entry point into the activity.

   Internally, the Emacs ‘bookmark’ library is used to save and restore
buffers’ states–that is, any major mode that supports the bookmark
system is compatible.  A buffer whose major mode does not support the
bookmark system (or does not support it well enough to restore useful
state) is not compatible and can’t be fully restored, or perhaps not at
all; but solving that is as simple as implementing bookmark support for
the mode, which is often trivial.

   Various hooks are (or will be–feedback is welcome) provided, both
globally and per-activity, so that the user can define functions to be
called when an activity is saved, restored, or switched from/to.  For
example, this could be used to limit the set of buffers offered for
switching to within an activity, or to track the time spent in an
activity.

1.1 GNU ELPA
============

‘activities’ may be installed into Emacs versions 29.1 or later from GNU
ELPA (https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/activities.html) by using the
command ‘M-x package-install RET activities RET’.  This will install the
latest stable release, which is recommended.


File: README.info,  Node: Quelpa,  Prev: GNU ELPA,  Up: Installation

1.2 Quelpa
==========

To install directly from git (e.g.  to test a pre-release version), it’s
recommended to use Quelpa (https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa):

  1. Install quelpa-use-package
     (https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation)
     (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
  2. Add this form to your init file (see *note Configuration:: for more
     details):

     (use-package activities
       :quelpa (activities :fetcher github :repo "alphapapa/activities.el"))

   If you choose to install it otherwise, please note that the author
can’t offer help with manual installation problems.

2 Configuration
***************

This is the recommended configuration, in terms of a ‘use-package’ form
to be placed in the user’s init file:

     (use-package activities
       :init
       (activities-mode)
       (activities-tabs-mode)
       ;; Prevent `edebug' default bindings from interfering.
       (setq edebug-inhibit-emacs-lisp-mode-bindings t)

       :bind
       (("C-x C-a C-n" . activities-new)
        ;; As resuming is expected to be one of the most commonly used
        ;; commands, this binding is one of the easiest to press.
        ("C-x C-a C-a" . activities-resume)
        ("C-x C-a C-s" . activities-suspend)
        ("C-x C-a C-k" . activities-kill)
        ;; This binding mirrors, e.g. "C-x t RET".
        ("C-x C-a RET" . activities-switch)
        ("C-x C-a b" . activities-switch-buffer)

3.1 Activities
==============

For the purposes of this library, an "activity" is a window
configuration and its associated buffers.  When an activity is
"resumed," its buffers are recreated and loaded into the window
configuration, which is loaded into a frame or tab.

   From the user’s perspective, an "activity" should be thought of as
something like, "reading my email," "working on my Emacs library,"
"writing my book," "working for this client," etc.  The user arranges a
set of windows and buffers according to what’s needed, then saves it as
a new activity.  Later, when the user wants to return to doing that
activity, the activity is "resumed," which restores the activity’s
last-seen state, allowing the user to pick up where the activity was
left off; but the user may also revert the activity to its default
state, which may be used as a kind of entry point to doing the activity
in general.


File: README.info,  Node: Compatibility,  Next: Modes,  Prev: Activities,  Up: Usage

3.2 Compatibility
=================

This library is designed to not interfere with other workflows and
tools; it is intended to coexist and allow integration with them.  For
example, when ‘activities-tabs-mode’ is enabled, non-activity-related
tabs are not affected by it; and the user may close any tab using
existing tab commands, regardless of whether it is associated with an
activity.


File: README.info,  Node: Modes,  Next: Workflow,  Prev: Compatibility,  Up: Usage

3.3 Modes
=========

‘activities-mode’
     Automatically saves activities’ states when Emacs is idle and when
     Emacs exits.  Should be enabled while using this package (otherwise
     you would have to manually call ‘activities-save-all’, which would
     defeat much of the purpose of this library).
‘activities-tabs-mode’
     Causes activities to be managed as ‘tab-bar’ tabs rather than
     frames (the default).  (_This is what the author uses; bugs present
     when this mode is not enabled are less likely to be found, so
     please report them._)


File: README.info,  Node: Workflow,  Next: Bindings,  Prev: Modes,  Up: Usage

3.4 Workflow
============

An example of a workflow using activities:

  1. Arrange windows in a tab according to an activity you’re
     performing.
  2. Call ‘activities-new’ (‘C-x C-a n’) to save the activity under a
     name.
  3. Perform the activity for a while.
  4. Change window configuration, change tab, close the tab, or even
     restart Emacs.
  5. Call ‘activities-resume’ (‘C-x C-a C-a’) to resume the activity
     where you left off.
  6. Return to the original activity state with ‘activities-revert’
     (‘C-x C-a g’).
  7. Rearrange windows and buffers.
  8. Call ‘activities-new’ with a universal prefix argument (‘C-u C-x
     C-a n’) to redefine an activity’s default state.
  9. Suspend the activity with ‘activities-suspend’ (‘C-x C-a s’) (which
     saves its last state and closes its frame/tab).

3.5 Bindings
============

Key bindings are, as always, ultimately up to the user.  However, in
*note Configuration::, we suggest a set of bindings with a simple
philosophy behind them:

   • A binding ending in a ‘C’-prefixed key is expected to result in the
     set of active activities being changed (e.g.  defining a new
     activity, activating one, or deactivating one).
   • A binding not ending in a ‘C’-prefixed key is expected to merely
     change an active one (e.g.  reverting it) or do something else
     (like listing activities.)


File: README.info,  Node: Commands,  Next: Bookmarks,  Prev: Bindings,  Up: Usage

3.6 Commands
============

‘activities-list’ (‘C-x C-a l’)
     List activities in a ‘vtable’ buffer in which they can be managed
     with various commands.
‘activities-new’ (‘C-x C-a C-n’)
     Define a new activity whose default state is the current frame’s or
     tab’s window configuration.  With prefix argument, overwrite an
     existing activity (thereby updating its default state to the
     current state).
‘activities-suspend’ (‘C-x C-a C-s’)
     Save an activity’s state and close its frame or tab.
‘activities-kill’ (‘C-x C-a C-k’)
     Discard an activity’s last state (so when it is resumed, its
     default state will be used), and close its frame or tab.
‘activities-resume’ (‘C-x C-a C-a’)
     Resume an activity, switching to a new frame or tab for its window
     configuration, and restoring its buffers.  With prefix argument,
     restore its default state rather than its last.
‘activities-revert’ (‘C-x C-a g’)
     Revert an activity to its default state.
‘activities-switch’ (‘C-x C-a RET’)
     Switch to an already-active activity.
‘activities-switch-buffer’ (‘C-x C-a b’)
     Switch to a buffer associated with the current activity (or, with
     prefix argument, another activity).
‘activities-rename’
     Rename an activity.
‘activities-discard’
     Discard an activity permanently.
‘activities-save-all’
     Save all active activities’ states.  (‘activities-mode’ does this
     automatically, so this command should rarely be needed.)

3.7 Bookmarks
=============

When option ‘activities-bookmark-store’ is enabled, an Emacs bookmark is
stored when a new activity is made.  This allows the command
‘bookmark-jump’ (‘C-x r b’) to be used to resume an activity (helping to
universalize the bookmark system).

4 FAQ
*****

How is this different from Burly.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/burly.el) or Bufler.el (https://github.com/alphapapa/bufler.el/)?
     Burly is a well-polished tool for restoring window and frame
     configurations, which could be considered an incubator for some of
     the ideas furthered here.  Bufler’s ‘bufler-workspace’ library uses
     Burly to provide some similar functionality, which is at an
     exploratory stage.  ‘activities’ hopes to provide a longer-term
     solution more suitable for integration into Emacs.

How does this differ from "workspace" packages?
     Yes, there are many Emacs packages that provide "workspace"-like
     features in one way or another.  To date, only Burly and Bufler
     seem to offer the ability to restore one across Emacs sessions,
     including non-file-backed buffers.  As mentioned, ‘activities’ is
     intended to be more refined and easier to use (e.g.  automatically
     saving activities’ states when ‘activities-mode’ is enabled).
     Comparisons to other packages are left to the reader; suffice to
     say that ‘activities’ is intended to provide what other tools
     haven’t, in an idiomatic, intuitive way.  (Feedback is welcome.)

How does this differ from the built-in ‘desktop-mode’?
     As best this author can tell, ‘desktop-mode’ saves and restores one
     set of buffers, with various options to control its behavior.  It
     does not use ‘bookmark’ internally, which prevents it from
     restoring non-file-backed buffers.  As well, it is not intended to
     be used on-demand to switch between sets of buffers, windows, or
     frames (i.e.  "activities").

"Activities" haven’t seemed to pan out for KDE. Why would they in Emacs?
     KDE Plasma’s Activities system requires applications that can save
     and restore their state through Plasma, which only (or mostly
     only?)  KDE apps can do, limiting the usefulness of the system.
     However, Emacs offers a coherent environment, similar to Lisp
     machines of yore, and its ‘bookmark’ library offers a way for any
     buffer’s major mode to save and restore state, if implemented
     (which many already are).

Why did a buffer not restore correctly?
     Most likely because that buffer’s major mode does not support Emacs
     bookmarks (which ‘activities’ uses internally to save and restore
     buffer state).  But many, if not most, major modes do; and for
     those that don’t, implementing such support is usually trivial (and
     thereby benefits Emacs as a whole, not just ‘activities’).  So
     contact the major mode’s maintainer and ask that ‘bookmark’ support
     be implemented.

Why did I get an error?
     Because ‘activities’ is at an early stage of development and some
     of these features are not simple to implement.  But it’s based on
     Burly, which has already been through much bug-fixing, so it should
     proceed smoothly.  Please report any bugs you find.

5.1 v0.6
========

*Additions*
   • Command ‘activities-switch-buffer’ switches to a buffer associated
     with the current activity (or, with prefix argument, another
     activity).  (A buffer is considered to be associated with an
     activity if it has been displayed in its tab.  Note that this
     feature currently requires ‘activities-tabs-mode’.)
   • Command ‘activities-rename’ renames an activity.
   • Option ‘activities-after-switch-functions’, a hook called after
     switching to an activity.
   • Option ‘activities-set-frame-name’ sets the frame name after
     switching to an activity.  (#33
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/activities.el/issues/33).  Thanks to
     JD Smith (https://github.com/jdtsmith).)
   • Option ‘activities-kill-buffers’, when suspending an activity,
     kills buffers that were only shown in that activity.

   *Changes*
   • Default time format in activities list.
   • When saving all activities, don’t persist to disk for each
     activity.  (#34
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/activities.el/issues/34).  Thanks to
     Al M.  (https://github.com/yrns) for reporting.)

File: README.info,  Node: v05,  Next: v04,  Prev: v051,  Up: Changelog

5.3 v0.5
========

*Additions*
   • Suggest setting variable ‘edebug-inhibit-emacs-lisp-mode-bindings’
     to avoid conflicts with suggested keybindings.
   • Option ‘activities-bookmark-warnings’ enables warning messages when
     a non-file-visiting buffer can’t be bookmarked (for debugging
     purposes).
   • Option ‘activities-resume-into-frame’ controls whether resuming an
     activity opens a new frame or uses the current one (when
     ‘activities-tabs-mode’ is disabled).  (#22
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/activities.el/issues/22).  Thanks to
     Icy-Thought (https://github.com/Icy-Thought) for suggesting.)

   *Changes*
   • Command ‘activities-kill’ now discards an activity’s last state
     (while ‘activities-suspend’ saves its last state), and closes its
     frame or tab.
   • Face ‘activities-tabs-face’ is renamed to ‘activities-tabs’, and
     now inherits from another face by default, which allows it to
     adjust with the loaded theme.  (#24
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/activities.el/issues/24).  Thanks to
     Karthik Chikmagalur (https://github.com/karthink) for suggesting.)

   *Fixes*
   • Show a helpful error if a bookmark’s target file is missing.  (#17
     (https://github.com/alphapapa/activities.el/issues/17).  Thanks to
     JD Smith (https://github.com/jdtsmith) for reporting.)
   • Sort order in ‘activities-list’.
   • When discarding an inactive activity, don’t switch to it first.
     (#18 (https://github.com/alphapapa/activity.el/issues/18).  Thanks
     to JD Smith (https://github.com/jdtsmith) for reporting.)
   • Don’t signal an error when ‘debug-on-error’ is enabled and a buffer
     is not visiting a file.  (#25
